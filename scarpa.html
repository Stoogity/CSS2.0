           <p class="review">The Scarpa Instinct is a family of shoes consisting of the Lace, Slipper, and VS, which stands for Velco Strap. There is also the VSR which is very similar to the VS with the exception that it uses a different rubber compound. We will be talking about the VS in this review.</p>

           <p>This shoe was the least comfortable of the three for me. It took two weeks of wearing the shoes at home while watching TV or playing games in order to help break them in so that it was cripplingly painful to climb in them. I'm not sure why this model in particular was so awful to break in, but once the process was done these shoes were very comfortable.</p>

           <p>Like the other shoes being reviewed, this pair is assymetrical. It is also a more aggressive shoe than the Tenaya Iati, but less aggressive than the Evolv Oracle. The toe profile is not as large as the Oracle, but is not as small as the Iati. The rubber compound used for this shoe is harder than the compound used on the Iati and the Oracle. This makes the shoe edge particularly well at the cost of having a less sticky rubber. The heel hook on this shoe was solid, as was this shoe's toe hooking ability. The toe hook was so solid due to the patch of rubber coating the upper toe box. </p>
