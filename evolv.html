           <p class="review">The Evolv Oracle is one of Evolv's newer shoes, although not the newest. It was designed to combine the Evolv Agro's heel design with the Evolv Shaman's toe design. Funnily enough, the Evolv Shaman's toebox hurts my toes, and the Oracle's toe box does not. The shoe is definitely not as comfortable as the Tenaya Iati, but I found it to be far more comfortable than the Scarpa Instinct. </p>
           <br></br>
           <p>What does the Oracle really excel at? I find that it does a fantastic job on overhanging terrain. This is because the Oracle is by far the most aggressive of the three pairs of shoes. The break-in period is more about wearing down the extremely aggressive toe than anything else. The Oracle does a fantastic job with toe hooks as well as excelling at overhanging terrain due to the entire top of the toe box being coated in sticky rubber. </p>
           <br></br>
           <p>Where this shoe (in my opinion) struggles is in the lack of sensitivity in the toes and the high profile toe-box. I have a very hard time getting the toes into small pockets and other small features common at the crags that I frequent.</p>
