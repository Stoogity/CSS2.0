       <p class="review">The Tenaya Iati is one of Tenaya's Aerial Plus line, which is its priciest tier of climbing shoes. Its price puts it in the same market as the top shoes from competing brands like Scarpa, La Sportiva, and Evolv, among many others. How does the Iati stack up?</p>
       <br></br>
       <p>The Tenaya Iati is absolutely the most comfortable of the three shoes being reviewed. It has a lycra sock that wraps the foot. In terms of performance, this is helpful as the climber is able to commit harder to movements without worrying about discomfort. With modern climbing shoes, this is less of an issue, but it is one that I think is still worth mentioning.</p>
       <br></br>
       <p>This shoe is highly assymetrical, which drives more power to the toes. This is important in a high performance shoe. The other shoes on this list are also assymetrical, however the Iati is both very precise due to its low profile toe and sensitive. I bought my first pair of Iatis almost five years ago and wore them for around two years before switching briefly to the Scarpa Instinct and later to the Evolv Oracle. I recently put these shoes back on in my home gym since my beat up pair of Oracles finally got a hole in the toe. I didn't realize what a boon the low profile toe was and I've honestly been going back to these shoes again and again ever since doing that. These shoes are the least aggressive of the three pairs, but I find that this doesn't bother me at all. I also find that the I am far more confident in my heel hooks when wearing this shoes as opposed to my Oracles. This could just be that the Iati fits me better (and frankly the advice that you should wear the shoe that fits you best is excellent advice) so take that for what it's worth. What the Iati does not do as well as the other two shoes on this list is toe hook. The Iati has a simple rubber strip on the toe that doesn't feel very grippy. Toe hooks don't feel very secure as a result.</p>
